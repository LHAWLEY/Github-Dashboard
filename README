A dashboard that polls and displays GitHub activity for the following frameworks: React, Angular, Ember, and Vue.

After reviewing the activity and events API on github, I decided to use the statistics, issues, and pull request endpoints because I thought I could do more interesting visualizations and metrics with the information.

The app tracks the number of commits per week and displays it in a histogram to visually show how many commits are made to each framework per week and what days the most commits were made in that particular week.  I monitor when when an issue was reported because I think that is an indicator of how engaged users are with the framework. Finally, I chose to monitor when the last pull request was updated because I feel like that shows how quickly the developers are to responding to input from users.  I think that these three metrics really help give an idea of how active the repo owners are and how involved users are with the repo.
